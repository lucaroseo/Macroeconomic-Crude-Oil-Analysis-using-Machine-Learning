# Macroeconomic Crude Oil Analysis using Machine-Learning

The aim of this Research Project is to analyse macroeconomic data about Crude Oil and try to understand how each variable could impacts others in order
to predict possible future price shock in the market. Data that we are going to use are public and provided from the U.S. Energy Information and 
Administration; in particular we will explore this variables: Export,Import,Refinery Capacity,Price, Stocks,Product Supplied and Production. 
Major premise: these data are not comprehensive of all of the informations that affect crude oil price and his variation during the time but we could 
assume that they are correlated with the trend of this commodity; beside that we are going to focus only on a limited period of time of these
variables (1992-2020), so models that we will obtain could be imprecise due to lack of some information (or variables) that are potentially correlated 
with the problem. Our studies will be focused on exploratory data analysis and the application of some supervised machine learning models like 
Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. Goal of this project is to discover if there could be a statistical advantage in predicting price
change in order to take financial decisions.
